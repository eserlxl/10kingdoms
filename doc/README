% Greetings reader, my purpose is a complete restoration of the original manual with the updates. Special attention has been given to preserving the original author's voice; Overall, however, this is a different manual with lots of minor and major differences, written with Modern Language Association style guidance and coded in LaTeX with Texstudio on a minimalist Texlive distribution on GNU/Linux. I tried to let LaTeX do everything automatically, but it isn't perfect nor am I; for I had never used LaTeX, so many errors remain such as the bad box issues I completely ignored unless it was visually disruptive. There is still much to improve. I welcome fellow community members to contribute to this manual. Signed with gratitude to everyone who put effort in it.
