# Memory Leak Fixes for 10kingdoms

## Overview

This document describes the memory leak fixes implemented in the 10kingdoms project based on Valgrind analysis. The fixes address both application-specific memory management issues and improve cleanup of external library resources.

## Valgrind Analysis Results

The Valgrind report showed several categories of memory leaks:

1. **External Library Leaks** (Not directly fixable):
   - PulseAudio memory leaks (256 bytes in 4 blocks)
   - DBus memory leaks (320-352 bytes in various blocks)
   - LLVM memory leaks (336 bytes in 1 block)
   - SDL-related memory leaks (520 bytes in 13 blocks)

2. **Application-Specific Leaks** (Fixed):
   - OpenAL audio resource leaks
   - SDL resource cleanup issues
   - Memory stream management issues

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. OpenAL Audio Memory Management Improvements

**File: `src/openal/openal_audio.cpp`**

#### Enhanced `deinit_wav()` method:
- Added proper context management before cleanup
- Force cleanup of all OpenAL sources and buffers
- Clear OpenAL error queue after cleanup
- Improved context switching logic

#### Enhanced `StreamContext` destructor:
- More thorough buffer cleanup (both processed and queued)
- Proper source stopping before cleanup
- Clear OpenAL error queue
- Better stream and data buffer cleanup

#### Improved error handling in `init_wav()`:
- Added proper cleanup on initialization failure
- Ensure context and device are properly released on error

### 2. SDL Resource Management Improvements

**File: `src/OVGA.cpp`**

#### Enhanced `Vga::deinit()` method:
- Added SDL_INIT_TIMER subsystem cleanup
- Added SDL error clearing
- Improved subsystem shutdown order
- Better context management for SDL resources

### 3. Memory Stream Management Improvements

**File: `src/mem_input_stream.cpp`**

#### Enhanced `MemInputStream` class:
- Improved `close()` method with complete state reset
- Better position management in `open()` method
- More thorough cleanup of owned data

**File: `src/openal/wav_stream.cpp`**

#### Enhanced `WavStream` class:
- Improved `close()` method with null pointer checks
- Better stream cleanup in destructor

### 4. System Cleanup Improvements

**File: `src/OSYS.cpp`**

#### Enhanced `Sys::deinit_directx()` method:
- Added debug logging for cleanup completion
- Better cleanup order management

### 5. Error Handling and Signal Management

**File: `src/AM.cpp`**

#### Added signal handlers:
- SIGINT (Ctrl+C) handler
- SIGTERM (termination request) handler
- SIGABRT (abort signal) handler

#### Enhanced error handler:
- Better cleanup during error conditions
- Additional debug logging

## Key Improvements

### 1. Resource Cleanup Order
- Ensured proper cleanup order (reverse of initialization)
- Added null pointer checks before cleanup operations
- Improved error handling during cleanup

### 2. External Library Integration
- Better OpenAL context management
- Improved SDL subsystem shutdown
- Enhanced error queue clearing

### 3. Memory Management
- More thorough cleanup of allocated resources
- Better state management in stream classes
- Improved destructor implementations

### 4. Error Recovery
- Added signal handlers for graceful termination
- Enhanced error handler for better cleanup
- Improved initialization error handling

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Run Valgrind again** to verify the fixes:
   ```bash
   valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all ./10kingdoms
   ```

2. **Test error conditions**:
   - Force program termination with Ctrl+C
   - Test with insufficient memory conditions
   - Test audio initialization failures

3. **Long-running tests**:
   - Run the game for extended periods
   - Test multiple game sessions
   - Verify no memory growth over time

## Notes

- Most of the reported memory leaks were from external libraries (PulseAudio, DBus, LLVM, SDL)
- These external library leaks are not directly fixable in the application code
- The implemented fixes focus on improving application-specific memory management
- Additional cleanup measures help reduce the impact of external library leaks

## Future Considerations

1. **Monitor external library updates** for potential memory leak fixes
2. **Consider using alternative audio backends** if PulseAudio leaks persist
3. **Implement more comprehensive memory tracking** for debugging
4. **Add memory usage monitoring** to detect potential issues early
